1) Using middleware
 --> An Express application is essentially a series of middleware function calls.
 --> Middleware functions can perform the following tasks:

        ->Execute any code.
        ->Make changes to the request and the response objects.
        ->End the request-response cycle.
        ->Call the next middleware function in the stack. (next())
        ->express stack consists of an array of these types of functions

2) **If the current middleware function does not end the request-response cycle, 
    it must call next() to pass control to the next middleware function.**

        -> Application level Middleware
        -> route level middleware
        -> Error handling middleware
        -> Built in middleware
        -> 3rd Party middleware

3) Middleware substacks can be added to routes
    app.get('/user/:id', function (req, res, next) {
    console.log('ID:', req.params.id)
    next()
    }, function (req, res, next) {
    res.send('User Info')
        })

    However you need to make sure to call next() after the final middleware function above, in order to make other routes are used
    for requests

4) Middleware can also be declared in an array for reusability.
